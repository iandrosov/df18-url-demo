/**
 A `SCSKnowledgeManager` object is used to interact with knowledge data such as
 category groups, categories, and articles.
 
 The knowledge manager abstracts the storage, network retrieval, and queries 
 for interacting with data in an efficient fashion. You can use this
 object to fetch categories and articles from your org. Once fetched, you 
 can use this object to get cached content. See the `SCSArticleQuery`
 class for an explanation on how to query for content.
 
 The knowledge manager caches data for offline use, allowing categories and 
 articles to be used even when no network is available.  To stay informed 
 about important changes in the underlying data model, any changes to the 
 underlying categories will be advertised through the use of the 
 following notifications:

 * `SCSKnowledgeManagerCategoryAddedNotification` -- A new category is added.
 * `SCSKnowledgeManagerCategoryUpdatedNotification` -- A category has been 
   modified (e.g. title, child categories, etc)
 * `SCSKnowledgeManagerCategoryDeletedNotification` -- A category has been deleted.

 The object of the notification will be the `SCSKnowledgeManager` instance 
 itself, while the category in question is stored in the notification's 
 `userInfo` dictionary under the `SCSKnowledgeManagerCategoryKey` key.
